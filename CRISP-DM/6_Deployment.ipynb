Plan deployment.\n","* The chosen model, once finalized, can be deployed as a web service using platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Tools like Flask or FastAPI can help in creating an API for the model.\n","2. Plan monitoring and maintenance.\n","* It's essential to monitor the model's performance over time. As new data becomes available, the model may need retraining or adjustments. Regular evaluations and feedback loops should be established.\n","3. Produce a final report.\n","* This would detail all the steps undertaken, models evaluated, their performances, and any insights or patterns observed from the data.\n","4. Review the project.\n","* Reflect on the goals achieved, challenges faced, and areas for improvement or exploration in future iterations.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CpHRNxQOQZ5E"}}]}
